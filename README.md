# Police Violence and Racial Equity Analysis

## Introduction 

From Rodney King to Trayvon Martin to Ma'Khia Bryant: the police violence against civilians in the United States is a fact, a significant socio-political challenge and a major human tragedy. In 2020, when one of the four police officers at the scene murdered a black American man George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, Floyd's last words 'I can't breath' became a slogan that lead to mass uprising in the US and across the world. Yet, since the arrest of his murderer Derek Chauvin, at least 3 people were [killed by the police](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html) every day. 

This project intends to analyze police violence across the United States, detect the states where the police is more prone to violence and analyze whether there is racial and/ or other bias in violent police behavior. For a brief project review, refer to the project presentation [slides](https://github.com/TamaraGR/Police_Violence_Analysis/blob/main/Police%20Violence%20Analysis%20Starter.pdf).
