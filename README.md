## Introduction 

From Rodney King to Trayvon Martin to Ma'Khia Bryant: the police violence against civilians in the United States is a fact, a significant socio-political challenge and a major human tragedy. In 2020, when one of the four police officers at the scene murdered a black American man George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, Floyd's last words 'I can't breath' became a slogan that lead to mass uprising in the US and across the world. Yet, since the arrest of his murderer Derek Chauvin, at least 3 people were [killed by the police](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html) every day. 

This project intends to analyze police violence across the United States, detect the states where the police is more prone to violence and analyze whether there is racial and/ or other bias in violent police behavior. For a brief project review, refer to the project presentation [slides](https://github.com/TamaraGR/Police_Violence_Analysis/blob/main/Police%20Violence%20Analysis%20Starter.pdf).

## Questions 

Below are the questions that the team is looking to address during this project: 

- [x] Map the violence/ shootings by race and zip code for all states (heat map)
- [x] Examine the victims for signs of mental illness, age, gender, armed/umarmed (pie charts)
- [x] Whether a body camera was on the police officer and what was the manner of death
- [x] What is the budget of the police agencies versus shootings?
- [x] Type of training and how often police officers are trained on de-escalation vs. shooting incidents
- [x] The city/ state with most killings 
- [x] Are the police racist, is there a correlation between amount of training and police misconduct, other trends? 
- [x] Which race is the highest victim of the police and does the police have bias toward them?
- [x] Years of Service to killings
- [x] Population trend (Race , Age, Criminal History)
- [x] Improper identification Killings

## Communications Protocols 

The project team is parking all the project documents in this GitHub repository under various branches and on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XFVpMkhayZw_rGAlpjGC60XuhsebHg0z). The team has set up a board of tasks that need to be accomplished on a weekly basis using Agile project management's Scrum methodology. The team meets twice a week (see the [team calendar](https://github.com/TamaraGR/Police_Violence_Analysis/blob/main/TIMELINE%20(1)%20(2).docx) for reference) via videocalls (Microsoft Teams and Google Meet), twice a week during the bootcamp classes and casually during teaching assistants' office hours. The team also communicates daily via Slack and Gmail. 

## Resources 

The following resources have been used so far. It is possible that during the life of the project additional resources will be added: 

- [x] [Washington Post Police Shooting Data 2015-2021](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)
- [x] [fatal-police-shootings-data.csv](https://github.com/TamaraGR/Police_Violence_Analysis/tree/amanda/Resources)
- [x] [Pandas Categorical Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html)
- [x] [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html)
- [x] [imbalanced-learn documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [x] [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)

#### Dependencies
-[x] Jupyter Notebook
- [x] Python v3.x
- [x] Pandas
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Seaborn
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] SciKit-Learn
- [x] Imbalanced-Learn

## Technology at use 

#### Database
Postgres SQL will be used for data cleaning and anlyzing our data. Additionally, Python (Pandas) may also be used to further explore our data. 
#### Host Instance 
Our data will be stored in AWS RDS.
#### Machine Learning (Python)
SciKitLearn will be used to create and test our machine learning model. Our ML model will test a predictive statistic.
#### Visualization
Tableau will be used to visualize our analysis. Our unique data will be visualized in a simplified manner so all stakeholders will be able to access the validity of our data. Data will be presented in a story format.

## Initial Data Analysis

To start off the project the team performed initial analysis of the data. Below are some of the findings: 

- [x] Despite the wide-spread misconception that growing attention to the police violence is improving the situation, the rate at which the law enforcement officers commit murder and other violence against the civilians remains the same:

- [x] While George Floyd's murderer was just convicted, overall there's little accountability for police brutality:

- [x] However, the nature of the police violence is evolving:

- [x] Black people are most likely to be killed by the police in the United States:

- [x] And black people are killed at higher rates than white people in 47 out 50 states:
