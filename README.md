## Introduction 

From Rodney King to Trayvon Martin to Ma'Khia Bryant: the police violence against civilians in the United States is a fact, a significant socio-political challenge and a major human tragedy. In 2020, when one of the four police officers at the scene murdered a black American man George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, Floyd's last words 'I can't breath' became a slogan that lead to mass uprising in the US and across the world. Yet, since the arrest of his murderer Derek Chauvin, at least 3 people were [killed by the police](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html) every day. 

This project intends to analyze police violence across the United States, detect the states where the police is more prone to violence and analyze whether there is racial and/ or other bias in violent police behavior. For a brief project review, refer to the project presentation [slides](https://github.com/TamaraGR/Police_Violence_Analysis/blob/main/Police%20Violence%20Analysis%20Starter.pdf).

## Questions & Initial Data Analysis

Below are the questions that the team is looking to address during this project: 

- [x] Map the violence/ shootings by race and zip code for all states (heat map)
- [x] Examine the victims for signs of mental illness, age, gender, armed/umarmed (pie charts)
- [x] Whether a body camera was on the police officer and what was the manner of death
- [x] What is the budget of the police agencies versus shootings?
- [x] Type of training and how often police officers are trained on de-escalation vs. shooting incidents
- [x] The city/ state with most killings 
- [x] Are the police racist, is there a correlation between amount of training and police misconduct, other trends? 
- [x] Which race is the highest victim of the police and does the police have bias toward them?
- [x] Years of Service to killings
- [x] Population trend (Race , Age, Criminal History)
- [x] Improper identification Killings
